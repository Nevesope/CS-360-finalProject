Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This app was built to help plan events and keep them organized to help buisness's and the users. The requirments were a login page with login credentials, an data page for the events with the oppurtunity to add or delete events, and a cotnact page to send texts to the users regarding updated information. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

For the UI design I chose to focus on a clean organized application that was user-friendly. I applied a minimal amount of buttons and information on each screen. The home screen is a drag and drop setup to add and delete events from this list. And the contact info page are simple toggles if you would liked to be contacted with more info. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

Zybooks and Youtube videos from my professor helped me to use best coding practices. I used onClickListeners for my buttons and tried to keep all my files fairly organized. I also took alot of tips form Android Studio to make the build easier for me. All of these skills cold be applied in future app building and I could get even better at organization. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I would build one page at a time and use the emulator to ensure the page was running properly. This was a tedious task however it helps because if you build to much sometimes it can be hard to locate the errors. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The biggest challenge I had is at one point something happened to the emulator. I couldn't get it to work for days and I couldn't test nay of my code properly. But i watched a lot of videos on how to resolve emulator issues and finally was able to fix it.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I feel that I was succesful in the layout for each screen font usage. I think I have a ton of improvment for this setup however I am happy from the outcome. I'm excited to see how much this course has advanced my skills especially with Java and Android Studio.
